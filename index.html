<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>I am a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University, Bloomington. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Georgia. My research interests fall into the domains of Knowledge Graphs, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text Mining, A.I. and Data Science.</p>

<h3>Past Teaching Profile</h3>

<h4>Spring 2024, CSCI-1360, Foundations for Informatics and Data Analytics</h4>
<p>The objective of this course is to familiarize students with scientific programming and data science principles through the utilization of the Python language. In this course, students engage in practical exercises to acquire skills relevant to quantitative analyses in various domains. The course begins with solid introduction to Python, empowering students with the basic programming skills. Students are introduced to data science-related mathematical concepts, then study data preprocessing and machine learning techniques. Students learn to apply skills and tools on
numerical, visual, and textual datasets.
<br />
<span>Teaching Duties</span>
<br />
Lesson planning, classroom instruction, design and grading assessments, office hour sessions and individual support to students who might need additional efforts.

<ul>
<li>Fall 2023, CSCI-1360, Foundations for Informatics and Data Analytics</li>
<li>Spring 2023, CSCI-1360, Foundations for Informatics and Data Analytics</li>
<li>Fall 2023, CSt1100, Intro to Software Engineering - South College</li>
<p>Topics introduced include foundational problem-solving using Java programming language, algorithm development, software applications, and programming using a procedural language.</p>
<li>Fall 2023, CST2400, Programming Languages - South College</li>
<p>Understand the language by creating working C# programs using both the simple command line and the Visual Studio environment, learn about data and how to input, store, and output data in C#, create GUI applications, explore classic programming structures—making decisions, looping, and manipulating arrays—and how to implement them in C#, provide a thorough study of methods, including passing parameters into and out of methods and overloading them, understand object-oriented concepts of inheritance and exception, learn how to save data to and retrieve data from files</p>
<li>CSCI-1301 Introduction to Computing and Programming</li>
<p><span>Terms:</span> Fall 2021, Spring 2021, Fall 2022, and Summer 2023<br />
This course provides a comprehensive initiation into problem-solving through essential programming techniques, encompassing concepts such as variables, operators, expressions, decision statements, loops, nested statements, arrays, methods, and object-oriented programming. The course involves hands-on experience in creating, testing, and debugging software through programming projects that integrate algorithm design and implementation using a structured computer language.</p>

<h3>Selected Teaching Feedback</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Student Feedback from CSCI-1360, Spring 2023</li>
<p>This course was very interesting and touched a variety of cool topics that were engaging, especially
for someone with little to no programming experience. I think that the activities were very helpful
in forcing us to get familiar with Python and think critically about designing solutions to the
provided questions. I might include more activities going forward, as I feel like the application of
the topics we learned in the notebooks was perhaps the most beneficial part of the course. Overall,
the course was a good experience and I look forward to taking more Python related courses.
